      Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
      industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents,
      Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the
      Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the
      outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne
      averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living
      off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his
      inherited conglomerate. He supports philanthropic causes through his
      nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity
      socialite. In public, he frequently appears in the company of
      high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne
      leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman
      account for most of his time. Various modern stories have portrayed the
      extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade. This is in
      contrast to the post-Crisis Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the
      true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade. In Batman
      Unmasked, a television documentary about the psychology of the
      character, behavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman's
      personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that "Batman,
      for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it,
      is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world
      better". Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and
      contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the
      story, and the timing. Grant Morrison notes that both heroes "believe in
      the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic
      roles display. He notes an equally stark contrast in their real
      identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social
      classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book
      Unleashing the Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce
      Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the
      crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman. Will Brooker notes in
      his book Batman Unmasked that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity
      lies with the young audience ... he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he
      just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the
      morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him
      ... and they're never wrong."
